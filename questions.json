"""
Hello there üëã

If you've been reading my previous email, you may be wondering:

- ‚ÄúWhy did you create a coaching and mentorship program?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat experts do you have to offer?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhy should I trust you?‚Äù

These are all great questions.

To answer them, let me tell you how I broke into the industry, learned the ins and outs of CTI, and what I learned along the way to help build a company specializing in CTI education.

[gif ‚Äì story time]

A long time ago, I was a professional ice hockey player.

üåé¬†I traveled the world playing hockey, from the United States to New Zealand. As I got older, time caught up with me, and I needed a new career.

After getting my bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science, I was always keenly interested in cyber security, so I decided to take the leap. I re-trained, got my master‚Äôs degree in cyber security engineering, and earned a bunch of entry-level certifications (including the infamous OSCP).

üë®‚Äçüíª¬†At the time (like most people new to cyber), I wanted to be a hacker, so I got an alphabet soup of certifications to land my first job.

Also, (like most people entering the industry) finding a job in penetration testing was incredibly difficult, so I settled on a role in security operations as a SOC analyst at a large managed security service provider (MSSP).

I learned much in this role, from practical skills to industry knowledge. I also discovered cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the area of cyber I would dedicate my career to mastering.

My next role was as a senior threat intelligence analyst at an international service provider, where I helped build a CTI and threat-hunting program from scratch.

‚ö°Ô∏è¬†We tracked threat actors, automated threat hunting, and built a comprehensive program capable of tackling the latest threats.

This was awesome.¬†It was everything I had dreamed of when I was studying to become a CTI analyst, and it was the job where I probably learned the most.

üò¢¬†Unfortunately, there is not much free learning content or coaching in the CTI field. You either pay a ludicrous amount to take a SANS course or spend hours, weeks, and even years in the saddle learning as you go.

This was frustrating because it took a long time to get the program to where we wanted it and figure out the best way of doing things.

‚ùå¬†We made many mistakes, wasted a lot of time, and incurred unnecessary costs to the business.

**If only there was another option!**

After building out the CTI program for this large service provider, I was headhunted to do the same at a large telecommunications company in the UK.

üôå¬†Thankfully, this time, I had learned from the school of hard knocks and hit the ground running.

We built a comprehensive CTI program in half the time, saved the business tons of money, and became innovators.

‚ù§Ô∏è I loved this experience. Things moved fast. People saw the value of a high-performance CTI program. We were¬†making a real difference.

In no time,¬†our program became the¬†most valuable asset in the company‚Äôs cyber security program and a priority in the business's budget (something not easily achieved).

**I just wished it hadn‚Äôt been this hard at first!**

[gif ‚Äì part 4]

Getting approval and funding for a CTI program is hard. Building a successful program is even harder. You can imagine how challenging it was for the team and me to face both these battles simultaneously!

It doesn‚Äôt have to be the same for you.

4. TASK: ANALYZE, CRITIQUE, AND REWRITE
Execute the following steps in order:

STEP A: INITIAL CRITIQUE & SCORECARD
Analyze the ORIGINAL EMAIL based on the following principles. Provide a score from 1-10 (1=Poor, 10=Excellent) for each, with a brief justification for your score.

Subject Line Clarity & Intrigue: Is it concise, value-driven, and compelling enough to earn an open?

Opening Hook Personalization: Does the first sentence immediately signal relevance and personalization?

Body Value Proposition: Is the core message focused on customer benefits over product features?

Readability & Formatting: Is the email easy to skim on a mobile device? (Short paragraphs, white space, bullets).

CTA Clarity & Friction: Is there a single, clear, low-friction Call-to-Action?

Tone of Voice: Is the tone conversational and human, or robotic and overly formal?

STEP B: PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
Based on established principles of persuasion (Cialdini, etc.), identify the following:

Persuasion Triggers Used: List any psychological triggers (e.g., Social Proof, Scarcity, Authority) present in the original email.

Missed Opportunities: List the top 3 most powerful psychological triggers that are MISSING and could be incorporated to make the email more persuasive.

STEP C: REWRITE THE EMAIL
Now, rewrite the ORIGINAL EMAIL from scratch to dramatically improve its effectiveness. Provide two distinct versions based on the likely recipient profile:

Version A: The "Director" Cut (Concise & Direct)

Target Persona: Optimized for a busy, analytical, results-driven executive (e.g., a 'D' or 'C' type in the DISC model).

Style: Extremely concise (ideally under 150 words), data-driven, and focused on the bottom-line outcome.

Version B: The "Influencer" Cut (Narrative & Relational)

Target Persona: Optimized for a more relationship-oriented, collaborative individual (e.g., an 'I' or 'S' type in the DISC model).

Style: Uses a warmer, more conversational tone, incorporates storytelling, and focuses on building rapport and demonstrating empathy.

STEP D: COMPONENT OPTIMIZATION
Provide 3-5 alternative, high-impact subject lines for the rewritten email. For each, briefly explain the psychological principle it uses (e.g., "Curiosity," "Personalization," "Urgency").

STEP E: EXPLANATION OF CHANGES
Conclude with a bulleted list that clearly explains the key strategic changes you made in the rewritten versions and why you made them, referencing the principles from your critique.

Example: "Changed the CTA from asking for time ('Book a call') to asking for interest ('Does this sound interesting?') to reduce friction and grant the prospect autonomy, which has been shown to double response rates."
